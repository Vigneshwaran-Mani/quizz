# quizz



## Technologies Used

I've used Ionic-Angular, Bootstrap, Django and MySql for this project. The Bootstrap plays the main role for the UI side and I used the django as a server-side. 

I've stored the Quiz data in assets folder. Before starting the project, You can alter the quiz-data.json file to have your own questions.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, do
```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ionic serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8100/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
