# quizz

## Technologies Used

I've used Angular, Angular Material, and Firebase for this project. The Angular Material plays the main role for the UI side and I used the firebase as a server-side. 

I've taken the Quiz data from the cloud firestore database. Before starting the project, Create one cloud firestore database in firebase. After that, you're able to see this screen.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, do
```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
